for the map example xml file run:

http://amble.lternet.edu:8080/exist/rest/db/util/xquery/getProjectsBySubSiteBoundingBox.xql?siteId=cap&_xsl=http://amble.lternet.edu:8080/exist/rest/db/util/xslt/subSiteMapConvert.xsl

with the appropriate siteId, and save in the directory the siteMap.html resides.

change the center point for the map to the appropriate place 

change the file name of the to the name the xml was saved under.

for a real application get a google map key and replace the one used here.
